They said I would have to wait a few minutes, so I did. A few minutes later I got my pizza and left. I later discovered that they put a 15-20 minute old $5 pepperoni pizza in my Extra Most Bestest box. I guess that's their way of refreshing their inventory when they made too many $5 pizzas and not enough $6 pizzas. I'll be on the lookout for this now.",12/2/2018,1.0 star rating
